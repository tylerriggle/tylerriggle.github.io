        <p>Deemed the Group of Death before the start of the tournament, the League of Legends World Championship's Group B faced some exciting and unpredictable twists. </p><p></p><p>The group contained the reigning (and soon-to-be again) World Champions, SKT T1; the only North American team to escape groups, Cloud9; the only number 1 seed to not escape groups, Flash Wolves; and an embattled, but feisty team from China, IMAY. </p><p></p><p>During group play, the juggernaut that was SKT stumbled at the hands Flash Wolves (known as the Korean killers), IMAY's support was suspended for one game following toxic behavior in his solo queue matches; and Cloud9, the home town favorite, looked confused, but resilient in a 70-minute-marathon match victory. </p><p></p><p>All of this resulted in a thrilling round of group stage matches where SKT came out on top, Cloud9 squeaked by in second, and Flash Wolves and IMAY were left on the outside looking in for the knockout rounds. </p><p></p><p>Knowing these results, we're going to take a look at some critical stats to see if we can find what SKT did that the other teams couldn't quite figure out.</p>

        <p>Gold share was calculated as a player's percentage of the team's total gold over the course of the entire group stage. This stat should give us insight into where the different teams are funneling their resources. </p><p></p><p>The most interesting thing in this chart is the relative similarity across all four teams, but some small different differences do jump out. SKT was pumping gold into their Attack Damage Carry; C9 focused on powering up their solo laners; and the bottom two teams put gold into their non-carry roles. </p><p></p><p>Damage share was calculated similarly to gold share, and should tell us who was doing the heavy lifting for the different teams. This chart has much clearer differentiation between the different teams revealing some interesting playstyles. </p><p></p><p>IMAY lived and died on the success of the ADC Jinjiao while Flash Wolves did the same with their mid-laner Maple. Cloud9 was much more top oriented hoping for Impact to take over the game with the help of his jungler Meteos. </p><p></p><p>SKT's bar may very well reveal the secret to their success. </p><p></p><p>They were not dependent on any one of their players to carry them. With balanced damage across the board (even their support led all supports in damage to balance the team even further), there was no single member for the other team to focus. </p><p></p><p>No matter who you killed on SKT, there were 4 other players ready to crush you.</p>

        <p>Utilizing the gold share and damage share information, we can combine these two stats to find the players who stepped up the most for their teams. </p><p></p><p>Taking damage share per gold share we get a stat that reveals who was doing the largest portion of their team's damage while receiving the fewest resources. Being able to pump out damage on small amounts of gold frees up the team to empower other members with larger amounts of gold. </p><p></p><p>The analysis shows Flash Wolves mid-laner, Maple, stands alone as the top carry in Group B. He's followed by the ADCs of the other three teams. Looking at how far down the chart Flash Wolves' ADC, NL, falls, this may imply that Flash Wolves needs to improve at their primary carry position in the bot lane. </p><p></p><p>The other interesting position of note is SKT's Wolf. Unlike the other three supports who have a stranglehold on the bottom of the graph, Wolf actually places above his own jungler on the graph along with IMAY and Flash Wolves' junglers as well. This again points to the damage diversity that SKT is able to cultivate within their team. </p>

        <p>Realistically, the six games played by each team in the group stages is a very small sample size. As we can see with this graph of Cloud9's game-to-game gold share (that includes their quarterfinals matches) it's hard to find a useful trend. Do they lose more often when they funnel gold into top? Or bot? Or mid? It's hard to say with this small sample size. They win games with different people doing well and lose games with different people struggling. </p><p></p><p>The clearest piece of useful information seems to be that damage needs to be evenly distributed among all members. SKT was the one team in the group that truly passed the eye-test as a great team, and their record reflects this observation. The other teams had outstanding individuals who were set up to do very well, but as the old saying goes "there's no 'I' in team." </p><p></p><p>Without teammates who can keep up and match them, the top tier carries on the other three teams couldn't do enough to match SKT.</p>
